# supa_library
The main idea of this repository is to upload everything that i will practice with Quarkus in order to have like a knowledge diary of the framework. 
From the basics until i finish the main idea of create a library system, separated in 3 microservices: Books, Students & Transactions that involve lending and collection of fines.
