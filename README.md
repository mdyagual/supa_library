# Supa_Quarkus_Library
The main idea of this repository is to upload everything that i will practice with Quarkus in order to have like a knowledge diary of the framework. 
From the basics until I finish the main idea of create a library system, separated in 3 microservices: Books, Students & Transactions that involve lending and collection of fines.

In order to be a lil bit more productive with what I code, specially when it is new for me, I will use one folder per project, 
plus _.mds_ files as a history record. So, if my future me needs to remember some stuff it will be easier. Specially when something gets wrong.

The main purpose is to redact how I did the 3 microservices. You know: Write about the issues, curious things,
attach some theory related to it. Honestly I will talk more about my struggling and how I figure it out.
Also, it is a good practice for my english side. (Yep, english is not my first language).

This repository is created with dedication and humble effort hopping another Quarkus devs has something to lean on nowadays considering
all the changes that the framework has suffered. 

**I'm still learning about the framework until now, that means I'm not a senior of it so, any productive comments are welcome.**

Enough blablabla, have a nice coding~
